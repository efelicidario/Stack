# a Makefile is a configuration file for a utility called 'make'
# if you simply run the make command it will look in the current directory for 
# a file called Makefile (this file) and use it to try to build everything for the rule 'all'

# and so on but that is not always the case
#
# this make file is a bit complicated but it is the base for all the labs and homeworks so there are 
# parts that may not be used for this particular assignment
